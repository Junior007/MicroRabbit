# MicroRabbit
My practices with RabbitMQ and micro-services.
The scope of this projects is generate two microservices and eventbus that work through MicroRabbitMQ for comunicate this events. Also has an user interface as MVC web.
Use MediatR, separate injection domain, own event bus with reflections and MediatR for execute handler and is part of udemy course (with some changes)
